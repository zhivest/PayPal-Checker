**PayPal Checker** is a tool used to verify the validity of PayPal accounts. This tool allows users to quickly check multiple PayPal accounts and separate the valid ones. Below, you can find detailed information on how to use and set up this project.



## Usage

PayPal Checker takes a list file and verifies each account in the list. After the verification process, valid and invalid accounts are separated, and the results are displayed on the screen or saved to another file.

Example usage:

```shell
email_pass.txt
```

```shell
python paypal_checker.py
```

```shell
python paypal_checker.py account_list.txt
```
